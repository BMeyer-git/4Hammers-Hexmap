# 4Hammers-Hexmap
These files are the heart of the hexagonal map generation used in 4HammersForge.com's interactive map segment.
Without a connection to the actual database, the map data isn't very useful, and there's a separate page designed to allow users to view and interact with the map.
However the files do provide insight into how various features on the displayed map are generated, and the css files make the hexagonal format possible.
